Authentication
==============

Tools that will be used:
    
    PassportJS
        Authentication is complicated and this package will make life easier, and many professional pages use PassportJS
        (At the end of the course, a deeper dive into the complexities of auth)
        
        -Has over 300 strategies (methods of doing something) for authentication
        
        -Has options for facebook, twitter, google, etc. authentication
        -Supports local log ins 
    
    Passport Local
        A scheme/strategy for authentication. This is the local Passport strategy
        that can be used for Username and Passwords that are used only on the site 
        
        Using local doesn't mean other methods are rendered unavailable, many ways of 
        authentication can be provided!
        
    Passport local mongoose 
        This is a package that is specifically made to work with mongoose and 
        help with authenticating user data related to the database 
        
Walk through of the authentication flow

    Home page: Log in, log out, register
        -> Secret page that can only be viewed if logged in 
        -> After registering / logging in, visit the secret page
        -> If logged out, secret page becomes unavailable again
        
    Key concept hinges on SESSIONS.
    
        HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the requests sent are one-time requests
        and don't contain information about the state of use, history of the user access, etc.
        
        Sessions are a way to provide HTTP requests with state so information can be 
        kept as long as a user is logged in or within a period of time that a user is using 
        the page. The information in the session is kept with the user so that the database
        and server can distinguish that a user has certain properties and values associated
        with how they are using the page, such as being logged in to a certain account. 
        
        Think of a session as a jar of data that is passed along to all the pages that are 
        visited and can be accessed by the server to tell the server information about the 
        user.
