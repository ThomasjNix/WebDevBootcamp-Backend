<h1>This README has been created so I don't have to keep copying over new copies of the same repo for future sessions. The updates are as follows, but you can also check the commit history.</h1>


<h3>Update!</h3>
<p>This bootcamp is COMPLETED as far as this repository is concerned! The following 3 sessions are as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Git and GitHub - <em>I will watch this but likely not take notes as Git is fairly straightforward and... well... I've been using Git and Github this entire time! So likely no surprises there.</em></li>
    <li>Deploying to Heroku - <em>Here I will be deploying only the last app (YelpCamp) to a Heroku page, which at some point will be linked through my portfolio. I will likely take notes on this session as well.</em></li>
    <li>Advanced JavaScript Topics - <em>I actually have already taken an advanced JS course on Udemy, "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts", and have notes hand written from when I took that. I may or may not take notes on this session, I am undecided as I have other things I would like to get some progress made on. I will watch it however, because no amount of practice is bad practice</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And with that, I (mostly) conclude this bootcamp project! It's been fun and I have learned a lot, and I look forward to applying what I know.</p>

<h3>Happy Coding!</h3>
