<h1>Important notice about this session</h1>

<p>Hello everyone reading, I felt it's important to note for this session that this project is INCOMPLETE. I marked this project as major becuase it will encompass front end, back end, and even databases.
 However, this specific session leaves the project incomplete until the next session is covered, which will talk about databases. In session28 this project will continue and here's some of the things that will be changes:
 
 </p>
 
 <ul>
    <li>Inline styles will be removed</li>
    <li>Stylesheets will be added</li>
    <li><strong>Database associations will be set up</strong></li>
    <li>Any leftover front end markup will be added</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't believe space will be an issue for Cloud9 as so far 6 sessions have only taken up 57MB of my allotted 2GB of free space on this workspace. 
Because of this, I will likely just copy over most of the files here and continue working on this in session 28. Session 27 will likely only be notes, so 
look forward to more coding in session 28!</p>

<h3>Happy coding!</h3>
