<h1>Thanks for checking this out!</h1>

<br>
<p>This repository is intended to be a continuation of the previous front-end repository for the online bootcamp on Udemy I've been coding along with (that repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/ThomasjNix/WebDevBootcamp"><strong>here</strong></a>).
I intend to use this repo to push all of my content from Cloud9 (excluding the massive list of packages and such files) to my GitHub so that it can be used as a reference when I need to do my server-side code.
</p>

<br>

<span>I will also be taking notes here and likely be using the same folder structure as I did in the previous repo.</span>

<br>


<h3>Happy coding!</h3>
